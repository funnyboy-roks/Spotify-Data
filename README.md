# Spotify Data Evaluator

A simple way to evaluate the data can be downloaded from Spotify.

## How to use

1. Download your data [from Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/)
2. Extract the `MyData` folder in the zip to the `data` folder in this repo
3. Run the `index.mjs` file while in the root of the repo
4. For now, you can view the data in `SongHistory.json`, sorted by the most listened to song.
